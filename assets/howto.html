The backbone of comics is a network consisting of 
over 34,000 associations (the edges) between over 
8,700 multiomics traits and disease endpoint (the nodes).
<p>

Comics allows the user to navigate this network by selecting 
focus nodes in the network. 
Comics then displays all n-th degree neighboring nodes up to a specified maximum number of nodes.
<p>

Once the first neighborhood is displayed, additional full next level neighborhoods 
of the focus trait shall be included, but only if the number of maximum nodes is not exceeded by doing so.
To avoid an overload of the server (which leads to a freeze of the network display and 
requires a reload of the page), the maximum number of nodes is currently limitted to 200.
<p>

One exception is that the first degree neighborhood of the focus trait shall always be displayed, 
even if this leads to an excess in the number of maxium nodes.
In some cases (hub nodes like "Diabetes") this can lead to "busy" networks with a slow response time.
<p>

<h4>Basic navigation</h4>
The "Network" tab is the main interface of comics.
A focus node can either be selected by clicking on a node in an already displayed sub-network, 
or using the pull-down menus "select platform" and "select trait".
The selected trait shall be displayed ion the "Click here to focus on ..." button.
Click this button to refocus the network display on the selected trait.
Adjust the "max nodes" pull-down menu to limit the number of maximum nodes
(select '1' to always show only the first degree neighborhood).
<p>

Hover with the mouse over the nodes and edges to display their properties.
<p>

Use the mouse to rearrange the network layout.
<p>

Hint: The pull-down menu "select trait" is searchable. In order to do so, 
hit the backspace key and then start typing (this is a shiny feature).
Use "select platform" to limit the number of items in the "select trait" pull-down menu.
<p>

<h4>Selecting pair-wise associations</h4>
The full set of all association data is available in shiny format in the "Tables" tab and can be searched
using the "Search" text box. Note that there are multipe tab for the different types
of association (GWAS, EWAS, RWAS, MBH, GGM, GENO, CATA, and STAT).
Click on a single association line in one of the table, and then on the button
"Click here to focus network on association ...".
This will display the neighborhoods of the two associated traits.
<p>

<h4>Exporting the displayed network</h4>
Use the "Export" tab to export all data from the current network.
If you want to export the entire comics dataset, you can download the Excel file 
provided on the comics <a href="https://github.com/karstensuhre/comics">comics GitHub page</a>.
The comics server uses this Excel file as input and starting point.
